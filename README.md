# Joredit-md, the editor that will revolutionize my knowledge of electron apps

Its just a tutorial project from codeacedemy to learn about creating apps with electron. The original project is
called [mook](https://github.com/kazuar/mook) and the tutorial can be found [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/heres-how-i-created-a-markdown-app-with-electron-and-react-1e902f8601ca/). Maybe if I get carried away I will actually
create a tool for personal use, I mean there are way to little good markdown editors to choose from... I always dreamed of
an editor that would introduce random typos in my text, so I could blame my editor for having dys... disleksia.... dyslexia
(who came up with that word) and feel better about myself.

- #### :information_source: If there are any typos in the following documentation it probably means that the editor is working

The name of the application was partly inspired by my first name in combination with its main purpose and to finish it of, the
last bit is a abbreviation of the `programming language` that it will be able to edit.
